# HaskellProblems
Solutions to problems posed in Haskell via learning at DelftX, LearnYouAHaskell and Programming in Haskell.

## Lab 01 - Caesar & Vigener Ciphers

This first lab required the user to write a set of Caesar and Vigener cipher functions, essentially a text mapping. This was further extended with a cracking function.

## Lab 02 - Credit Card Check

`isValid` defines a function that takes an integer and returns boolean true/false if it validates as a credit card number.

`numValid creditCards` runs a series of possible credit cards against the `isValid` function and returns the number that satisfy its check.

## Lab 03 - Higher Order Functions & Function Composition

A series of problems involving higher order functions and function composition in Haskell.

## Lab 04 - Recursive Functions

A series of problems which could be implemented in many ways but are intended to illustrate the simplicity, ease and clarity of a recursive programming style.
