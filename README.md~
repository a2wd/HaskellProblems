# HaskellProblems
Solutions to problems posed in Haskell via learning at DelftX, LearnYouAHaskell and Programming in Haskell.

## Lab 01 - Caesar & Vigener Ciphers

This first lab required the user to write a set of Caesar and Vigener cipher functions.

## Lab 02 - Credit Card Check

`isValid` defines a function that takes an integer and returns boolean true/false if it validates as a credit card number.

`numValid creditCards` runs a series of possible credit cards against the `isValid` function and returns the number that satisfy its check.
